Bring your own laptop and together we will create an entire 3D virtual sculpture exhibition from scratch in 90 minutes. By the end of the class, you will have a fully playable, first-person 3D environment populated with digital sculptures by your peers! The workshop portion will be fun, freeform, and fast-paced, focusing on learning software skills through play, collaboration, and improvisation. A variety of techniques and software will be explored and will be tailored greatly to everyone’s skill-level and interest. This class explores software for artists–focusing on results instead of best practices. It is perfect for the beginner or traditional artist\/designer who is interested in coding and video games, but intimidated by the technical barriers of traditional computer-science focused programming classes. If you already have these technical skills, this class is a great way to open up your creative practice and learn to work in a way that is less structured.<\/p> <p>Skills and tech explored: Unity3d, Basic 3d modeling and texturing, programming fundamentals.

When you add a “to do” item in Clear, or move from category to story detail in Facebook Paper, you experience a new standard in interface response using animation and sound.<\/p> <p>Mobile developers and designers have a multitude of opportunities to inform and delight in those spaces in between major actions. When done well, unique transitions can add playfulness, meaning, and interest to your mobile solutions. When done badly, they can frustrate users with long wait times, or obscure the relationships between elements of your product.<\/p> <p>In this session we’ll explore the power of transitions in the mobile space, and discuss:<\/p> <p>Why is it important to consider transitions?

But they felt uneasy over their good fortune. Most African Americans live in economically starved neighborhoods. Black wealth is about one tenth of white wealth, and black businesses lag behind businesses of all other racial groups in every measure of success. <\/p> <p>\n\n\nOn January 1, 2009 the Andersons embarked on a year-long public pledge to \"buy black.\" They thought that by taking a stand, the black community would be mobilized to exert its economic might. They thought that by exposing the issues, Americans of all races would see that economically empowering black neighborhoods benefits society as a whole. Instead, blacks refused to support their own, and others condemned their experiment. Drawing on economic research and social history as well as her personal story, Maggie Anderson shows why the black economy continues to suffer and issues a call to action to all of us to do our part to reverse this trend.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/5\/2\/4\/600_410285412.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/e\/8\/600_410286632.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i><b>Our Black Year<\/b><\/i> is available on every format: Hardcover, paperback, kindle, and e-book.<\/p> <p>Per our previous Book Club Meetings, <b><i>you may bring a dish\/beverage or a $10.00 donation<\/i><\/b>.
